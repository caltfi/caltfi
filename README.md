### Hey, I'm Calum!

I am a full-stack developer from Cork, Ireland. My website is **[here](https://www.calumfenton.com)**.

### Current Project

Here is a project I am currently working on. It is an educational tool for learning about the solar system. I am making it with Three.js!

[![Readme Card for Solar System in JS](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=caltfi&repo=solar_system)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
